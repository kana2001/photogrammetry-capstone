## Usage
Each folder is assigned to a module of the capstone. Ex: all webApp code should be stored in webApp.

## Tutorials
If you have never used git/github before I recommend this short video to get a jist of it:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv8rSLsi1xo

If you are inclined to learn more feel free to checkout any of the one hour ones:

But for the purposes of this capstone, we will probably only be dealing with a few commands
- git add
- git commit
- git pull
- git push
